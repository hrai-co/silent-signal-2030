SilentSignal 2030
Transparent Performance Evaluation Prototype

🔗 Live Demo:
https://hrai-co.github.io/silent-signal-2030/

📌 Project Overview

SilentSignal 2030 is a conceptual UX prototype that reimagines corporate performance evaluation systems through continuous behavioral signal transparency.

Traditional performance reviews are often:

Annual and reactive

Opaque and unclear

Outcome-focused rather than behavior-focused

Anxiety-inducing

This prototype demonstrates a future-facing model where workplace growth is visualized dynamically through measurable behavioral signals.

🎯 Core Concept

Instead of hidden scoring and yearly surprises, SilentSignal 2030 introduces:

Continuous signal-based evaluation

Behavioral metrics over bias

Transparent trajectory modeling

Real-time growth visualization

The project is designed as a frontend-only academic prototype to demonstrate interaction design, UI systems, and JavaScript-based simulation logic.

🧠 Key Features
1️⃣ Multi-Page UX Structure

Home (Concept Introduction)

The Problem (System critique)

Signals (Behavioral framework)

Simulation (Interactive model)

Vision 2030 (Structured manifesto + future scenario)

2️⃣ Interactive Growth Simulation

Users adjust six behavioral signals:

Collaboration

Communication

Initiative

Adaptability

Responsiveness

Emotional Intelligence

The system:

Calculates the average signal strength

Updates every 5% dynamically

Fills a visual "growth tank" using animated water simulation

Displays percentage inside the tank

Shows contextual growth tier (e.g., Emerging, Growing, Thriving, Elite)

This demonstrates:

DOM manipulation

Event handling

Dynamic style updates

Conditional logic

UI feedback systems

3️⃣ Animated Water-Fill Visualization

Instead of a static line graph, the simulation uses:

A vertical container fill system

Gradient-based growth levels

Subtle animated wave effect

Smooth CSS transitions

Real-time percentage display

This improves engagement while maintaining academic clarity.

4️⃣ Design & UX Decisions

Clean typography (Inter + Playfair Display)

Responsive grid layout

Subtle global fade-in animation

Reusable card system

Minimalistic academic aesthetic

Fixed navigation with scroll-based shadow effect

🛠 Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Animations, Transitions)

Vanilla JavaScript (No libraries)

GitHub Pages (Deployment)

📚 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates understanding of:

Responsive design principles

CSS Grid layout systems

DOM querying and manipulation

Event-driven programming

Conditional rendering

Animation systems using CSS

UX modeling for conceptual systems

Notably, JavaScript was self-learned and implemented beyond the scope of the base course requirements.

🚀 Scalability Potential

While currently a frontend prototype, this system could scale into:

Real-time behavioral analytics platform

AI-assisted workplace feedback system

Organizational transparency dashboard

Ethical performance modeling tool

Enterprise HR integration system

Backend integration could allow:

Data persistence

Role-based dashboards

Team-level analytics

Longitudinal growth tracking
